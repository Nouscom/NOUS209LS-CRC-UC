# NOUS-209 Off-the-Shelf Immunotherapy: Targeting Primary and Metachronous Colorectal and Urothelial Cancer in Lynch Syndrome

This repository accompanies the scientific publication:

**"NOUS-209 off-the-shelf immunotherapy has the potential to hit primary and metachronous colorectal and urothelial cancer in Lynch syndrome"**

## Overview

Lynch syndrome (LS) is characterized by the development of microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors, which share frameshift-derived neoantigens. In this study, we investigated the potential of **NOUS-209**, a viral vector-based cancer vaccine encoding 209 shared neoantigen peptides, to target both primary and metachronous colorectal and urothelial cancers in LS patients.

Key findings include:

-	Broad presence of Nous-209 neoantigens in both colorectal cancers (CRCs) and urothelial cancers (UCs) from LS
-	Consistent number of Nous-209 neoantigens across primary and subsequent tumors
-	Subsequent tumors, shaped by immune pressure, still generate vaccine-relevant Nous-209 neoantigens 
-	Immune escape mechanisms, such as complete loss of Beta-2 macroglobulin, are more frequent in advanced stages tumors and are unlikely to limit treatment efficacy at very early stage 

## About This Repository

This repository contains the **R scripts used to generate the main figures** presented in the publication.

> **Note:** The final figures in the manuscript have been **further refined using graphic design software**. The scripts here generate the base plots prior to aesthetic adjustments.

- All scripts are organized by figure number.
- Data inputs required to run the scripts are **available upon request**.

## Requirements

The analysis was performed using R (version >= 4.3). Specific package requirements are listed at the beginning of each script.

## Contact

The input files necessary to reproduce the analyses and generate the plots **may be made available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request and subject to institutional approval**.
